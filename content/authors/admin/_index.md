<!-- Hi, I'm Jingze. I am a third-year graduate student in the Department of Industrial Design at Southeast University, under the supervision of [Prof. Yafeng Niu](https://me.seu.edu.cn/nyf_31777/list.htm) and [Prof. Chengqi Xue](https://me.seu.edu.cn/xcq/list.htm). I hold a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Southeast University. 

üö©I will complete my master's degree in June 2024 and am currently pursuing a **Ph.D. opportunity (2024 fall)**! -->

I design and evaluate user-centered interfaces using diverse technologies to enhance performance and user experience. Also, I aim to explore and improve the accessibility of immersive technologies. 

üö©I am eager to discuss and potentially extend collaboration with people who share common research interests. Please feel free to contact me if you are among them!:smile:
